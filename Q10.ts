
//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment
// to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
//because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current
// date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
//describing what the program does.

// let a=20;
// let b=10;
//Addition:
// console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${a+b}`);
//Subtraction:
// console.log(`${a} - ${b} = ${a-b}`);
//Multiplication:
// console.log(`${a} * ${b} = ${a*b}`);
//Division:
// console.log(`${a} / ${b} = ${a/b}`);
